# Content Moderation Project

## Overview

This project implements **content moderation** using machine learning and rule-based approaches. It is designed to detect toxic, harmful, or inappropriate content across multiple modalities such as **text or video**.

The core of the implementation is structured inside a Jupyter Notebook (`Content_Moderation.ipynb`) where different models and techniques are applied step by step.

---

## ¬†Features

- **Text Moderation**: Detects toxic, hateful, or offensive language using NLP models.
- **Video Moderation**: Applies frame-based analysis and blur techniques to hide violent/explicit content.
- **Visualization**: Highlights detected content with bounding boxes, blurring, and alerts.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
python >= 3.8
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
opencv-python
tensorflow or pytorch
transformers
librosa
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Content_Moderation.ipynb
   ```
2. Run cells step by step.
3. Provide input text or video.
4. Get predictions and moderated output.

## Example Outputs

- **Text** ‚Üí "You are stupid" ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è *Toxic content detected.*
- **Video** ‚Üí Violence detected ‚Üí üî≤ *Blurred with bounding box.*



---

## Limitations

- Model accuracy depends on training data.
- False positives/negatives may occur.
- Performance may vary with large video/audio files.

---

## Future Improvements

- Real-time moderation for live streams.
- Working on audio or image input format
- Integration with APIs for deployment.
- Multi-language support for text moderation.
- Better explainability for flagged content.
